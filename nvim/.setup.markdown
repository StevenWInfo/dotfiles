#Neovim directory setup

Since all of the plugins I use are in github already, there's no point in taking up more space in the repo with them. I might eventually use submodules. However, I would like to list which plugins I use for reference.

##Plugins

- base16-vim

- neomake

- rust.vim

- vim-airline

- vim-fugitive

- vim-hdevtools
    - Removed this one because some requirements weren't working.

- fzf.vim

- ag.vim

- idris-vim
